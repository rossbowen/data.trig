# data.trig

A repository containing [an example](data.trig) of how to represent statistical data as RDF, attempting to implement the [Data on Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/).

The example takes inspiration from the [DCAT v3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), [RDF Data Cube](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) and [CSV on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) standards.
